# Predictive Maintenance

Using an accelerometer mounted on the machine sending data to the raspberry pi, the project continuously analyzes machine vibrations through FFT analysis to understand mechanical faults in the system and decide when maintenance will be required. The magnitude and frequency response data is continuously uploaded to an IoT cloud server for analysis over a larger period of time. This enables the maintenance team to flag machinery issues earlier, prioritize by the severity of fault and take actions proactively.
